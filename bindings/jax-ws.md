> This module can be used to add TracEE context propagation support to Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) API for endpoints and webservice clients.

Please add the following dependencies to enable TracEE JAX-WS support. For example in maven-style projects add to the pom.xml:

```xml
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.tracee.binding</groupId>
        <artifactId>tracee-jaxws</artifactId>
        <version>RELEASE</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>
```

## Using server side handlers
You can use the context logger by annotating your jax-ws webservice with the `@HandlerChain` annotation.

```java
@Stateless
@WebService(serviceName = "TraceeJaxWsTestService", portName = "TraceeJaxWsTestPort",
    targetNamespace = "https://github.com/tracee/tracee/examples/jaxws/service/wsdl")
@HandlerChain(file = "/traceeHandlerChain.xml")
public class TraceeJaxWsTestService implements TraceeJaxWsTestWS {
    ...
}
```


Therefore you have to add the referenced `traceeHandlerChain.xml` file to your classpath (i.e. `/src/main/resources`). The file must have the following content:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?>
<javaee:handler-chains xmlns:javaee="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee">
    <javaee:handler-chain>
        <javaee:handler>
            <javaee:handler-class>io.tracee.binding.jaxws.TraceeServerHandler</javaee:handler-class>
        </javaee:handler>
    </javaee:handler-chain>
</javaee:handler-chains>
```

## Using client side handlers
First you have to create the client stub classes for the webservice wsdl.
Then you are able to bind the error context logger by using the services handler resolver mechanism:

```java
final TraceeJaxWsTestService testWebservice = new TraceeJaxWsTestService(
    new URL("http://localhost:8080/yourTestService/webservices/YourTestService?wsdl"));
testWebservice.setHandlerResolver(TraceeClientHandlerResolver.buildHandlerResolver().add(TraceeClientHandler.class).build());
final YourTestWS ws = testWebservice.getPort(YourTestWS.class);
```

## Background

When the client sends a request to the server and he sends an response back, both kinds of message (request and response) have an outgoing and an incoming part. We can count four phases:

    Clients sends the request: RequestOut
    Server receives the request: RequestIn
    Server sends back the response: ResponseOut
    Client receives the response: ResponseIn

In JAX-WS we can  use HandlerChains to intercept requests and responses at client and server side.
Therefore TracEE offeres two kind of SOAPHandler: `TraceeServerHandler` and `TraceeClientHandler`.
